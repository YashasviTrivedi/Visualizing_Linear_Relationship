# Visualizing_Linear_Relationship

**Project Summary:**

The project aims to analyze and visualize data from an Instagram dataset stored in a CSV file. The key steps in the project include:

1. **Data Import and Cleaning:**
   - The project starts by importing the dataset using the Pandas library.
   - The data is cleaned to remove any rows with missing values.

2. **Plotly Express Scatter Plot:**
   - The first visualization is created using Plotly Express.
   - It generates a scatter plot that explores the relationship between 'Impressions' and 'Likes.'
   - The size of the markers on the plot is determined by the number of 'Likes.'
   - A trendline based on ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is added to the plot.

3. **Matplotlib and Seaborn Scatter Plot with Regression Line:**
   - Another scatter plot is created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - It also visualizes the relationship between 'Impressions' and 'Likes' with a regression line.
   - The 'fivethirtyeight' style is applied to the plot for a specific aesthetic.
   - A title, "Relationship Between Likes and Impressions," is added to the plot.

The project focuses on exploring and visualizing the correlation between 'Impressions' and 'Likes' on Instagram, using two different plotting libraries (Plotly Express and Matplotlib/Seaborn) to provide different perspectives on the data.

This analysis and visualization can be valuable for understanding how Instagram impressions relate to the number of likes received and identifying any trends or patterns in the data.
